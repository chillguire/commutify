# Commutify
Commutify was one of my firsts *big* iOS projects. It is an iOS app built primarily in **UIKit** and **Firebase** that I developed to apply my knowledge on TableViews and Firebase. It basically allows you to chat in a public room with multiple users where you can see their messages and usernames.
